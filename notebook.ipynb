Number of Customers per Sales Method (Top-Left)**\n\n- What it shows: A bar chart comparing how many customers used each sales method.\n\n- Interpretation:\n    - Email is the most commonly used method.\n    - Call comes second.\n    - Email + Call is the least used, but likely more targeted.\n\n**2. Revenue Distribution by Sales Method (Top-Right)**\n\n- What it shows: A boxplot showing how revenue varies by sales method.\n\n- Interpretation:\n    - Email + Call yields the highest median revenue and has the least variability     - great for consistent results.\n    - Email has moderate revenue but high variability.\n    - Call has the lowest revenue on average.\n\n**3. Weekly Revenue by Sales Method (Bottom-Left)**\n\n- What it shows: Line plot of total weekly revenue for each sales method over six weeks.\n\n- Interpretation:\n    - Email starts strong but declines over time.\n    - Email + Call gains traction and overtakes Email by week 5.\n    - Call is the most stable, but contributes the least.\n\n**4. Customer Tenure by Sales Method (Bottom-Right)**\n\n- What it shows: Boxplot showing how long customers have been with the company for each method.\n\n- Interpretation:\n    - All methods have similar tenure distributions, though Email has more outliers (very long-time customers).\n    - Slight indication that Call might be used more with newer customers.\n\n\n**5. Distribution of Revenue**\n\n![Bar chart, box plot and line chart](histogram.png)\n\n- What it shows: Histogram showing the distribution of revenue across all customers, regardless of sales method.\n\n- Interpretation:\n    - Revenue data is multi-modal, suggesting distinct customer segments.\n    - The most common revenue bands are around \\$40-50 and \\$90–100, likely linked to specific sales methods (e.g., Call and Email).\n    - A third peak near $180–200 suggests Email + Call drives higher revenue but is less frequently used.\n    - The presence of a long right tail indicates a few customers generate significantly higher revenue.\n    - Overall, the chart reinforces the idea that different sales methods are associated with different revenue levels.\n\n**Metric for the Business to Monitor**\n\n**Metric Name**: Revenue per Customer (RPC)\n\n- We use this metric beccause it combines customer acquisition and revenue performance into one simple number.\n- It gives insight into how much value (in revenue) the business earns per individual customer.\n- This makes it easier to compare performance across different sales methods and time periods.\n\n\n**1. How should the business use this metric?**\n\n- Use RPC to compare the effectiveness of different sales methods.\n- Higher RPC means that method is generating more value per customer.\n- Allocate more resources to the sales methods with the highest RPC.\n- Re-evaluate or improve the methods with consistently low RPC.\n- Use it weekly or monthly to measure the impact of marketing or sales campaigns.\n- Identify high-RPC customer segments for personalized targeting.\n\n**2. Estimated Initial Values (based on current data)**\n\n|Sales Method|Total Revenue|Customers|Revenue per Customer (RPC)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Email|$853,387.29|7,529|$113.33|\n|Call|$258,865.40|4,949|$52.31|\n|Email + Call|$895,896.53|2,547|$351.74|\n\n**Key Insight**:\n- Email + Call has the highest RPC by a wide margin → it generates the most revenue per customer.\n- Despite fewer customers, it brings higher value, so this method should be expanded and optimized.\n\n\n\n**Final Summary & Business Recommendations**\n\n**Summary of Key Insights**\n- Customer Distribution:\n    -The majority of customers prefer the Email sales method, followed by Call, and lastly Email + Call.\n\n**Revenue Patterns:**\n\n- Email + Call generates the highest revenue per customer (RPC), indicating it is the most effective method for monetization.\n- Call has the lowest RPC, suggesting it may not be cost-effective on its own.\n- Email brings in solid customer numbers but shows declining revenue over time, likely due to saturation or fatigue.\n- Weekly Revenue Trends:\n-Email starts strong but drops, while Email + Call grows steadily over time indicating strong long-term potential.\n\n**Customer Tenure:**\nCustomers across all methods have similar tenure, so tenure isn’t a key driver of sales method success.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Double Down on Email + Call Strategy\n- It brings highest revenue per customer and shows growing weekly revenue trends.\n- Consider scaling this method—automate where possible, and personalize outreach.\n\n2. Revamp Standalone Call Strategy\n- With the lowest RPC, calls alone may not be converting well.\n- Use calls only in combination with other channels like email or web engagement.\n\n3. Reinvigorate Email-Only Campaigns\n- Email has a large customer base but is declining in effectiveness.\n- Introduce A/B testing, better segmentation, or fresh campaign designs to boost performance.\n\n4. Track Revenue per Customer (RPC) Weekly\n- Use RPC as a KPI to evaluate each sales method's efficiency.\n- Monitor weekly changes to quickly identify underperforming campaigns.\n\n5. Customer Experience Focus\n- Although customer tenure is similar across methods, improving experience (especially for high-value RPC channels) can drive loyalty and retention.\n","metadata":{},"id":"c22f7f5b-2a69-4515-8b29-7b0e94829f11","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
